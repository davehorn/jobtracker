**Solution Applied:**
- Updated `/src/app/api/config/route.ts` to explicitly specify which fields to update
- Mirrored the approach used in the create operation for consistency
- Regenerated Prisma client to ensure schema alignment
- Verified TypeScript compilation remains clean

**Result:** Configuration save/load functionality now works correctly with the streamlined 2-service architecture.

## Review Section

**Completed:** 2025-07-03 at 8:15 PM EST

### Changes Made

**Job Management Page (`/src/app/jobs/page.tsx`):**
- Fixed `salaryRange` label: now shows "(Applied)" with green color (user-entered salary)
- Fixed `providedSalaryRange` label: now shows "(Posted)" with normal color (job posting salary)
- Swapped color coding: green for applied salary, normal for posted salary

**Job Detail Page (`/src/app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`):**
- Fixed `salaryRange` label: changed from "(Estimated)" to "(Applied Salary)" with green color
- Fixed `providedSalaryRange` label: changed from "(Applied Salary)" to "(Posted Salary)" with normal color
- Applied consistent color coding with Job Management page

### Technical Implementation
- **Files Modified:** 2 files (same files as Phase 6)
- **Lines of Code Changed:** ~8 lines (label and color corrections)
- **TypeScript Compilation:** ✅ Clean build with no errors
- **UI Consistency:** Maintained existing design patterns with corrected semantics

### Functionality Verification
- ✅ `salaryRange` now correctly labeled as "Applied" salary (user-entered)
- ✅ `providedSalaryRange` now correctly labeled as "Posted" salary (from job posting)
- ✅ Visual distinction maintained: green for user-applied, normal for job-posted
- ✅ Labels are now clear and intuitive for users
- ✅ Consistent labeling across both Job Management and Job Detail pages

### Results
Salary range field labels now correctly reflect their actual meaning:

1. **Applied Salary** (`salaryRange`) - Green colored, represents what the user applied for
2. **Posted Salary** (`providedSalaryRange`) - Normal colored, represents what was posted on the job

The correction eliminates confusion and provides users with clear understanding of which salary range is which.

**Total Development Time:** ~15 minutes  
**Impact:** Corrected confusing labels, improved user clarity  
**Code Quality:** Simple, accurate label corrections

### Results

The error logging implementation provides complete visibility into configuration save operations:

1. **Server-Side Logging**: All API operations now log to terminal with detailed information
2. **Client-Side Logging**: Frontend operations log to browser console with request/response details
3. **Error Visibility**: Actual error messages and stack traces are now visible to developers
4. **Request Tracking**: Complete request/response cycle is logged for debugging
5. **User Experience**: Users still see friendly error messages while developers get detailed debugging info

### Debugging Information Now Available

**When configuration save fails, developers can now see:**
- Exact error message and stack trace
- Database operation details
- Request body structure and validation
