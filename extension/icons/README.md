# Extension Icons

For development, you can:
1. Use the provided icon.svg as a base
2. Convert to PNG using online tools or image editors
3. Create icons at sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128

Alternatively, you can use simple colored squares for testing:
- Background: #3B82F6 (blue)
- Text: "JT" in white
- Border radius: 16px for rounded corners

This README serves as a placeholder until proper PNG icons are created.
